This program is my approach of the Vending Machine problem.

## Statement:
### You need to design a Vending Machine which
* Accepts coins of 0.05€, 0.10€, 0.20€, 0.50€, 1€, 2€
* Allow user to select products Coke(1.50€), Sprite(1.40€), Water(0.90€)
* Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
* Return selected product and remaining change if any
* Allow the vending machine supplier to refill beverages & coins for change.

### Constraints:
* do not use databases. Save the state in memory.
* do not use IoC frameworks (such as Spring or Guice)
* make a rational use of libraries/dependencies (you can explain your decisions of why to include or not if you doubt whether you should or should not)
